= Building a microservice with MongoDB

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to store data with `MongoDB` using CDI and MicroProfile Config.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple microservice which manages the members of a crew using `MongoDB`. The service will respond to `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests made to the http://localhost:9080/mongo/crew/[^] URL.

The microservice's response to a `GET` request is with an array containing the JSON representation of the crew members' information like this:

[source,json,role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "5dee6b079503234323db2ebc"
    },
    "Name": "Member1",
    "Rank": "Captain",
    "CrewID": "000001"
  },
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "5dee6b079503234323db2ebd"
    },
    "Name": "Member2",
    "Rank": "Engineer",
    "CrewID": "000002"
  }
]
----

This microservice connects to `MongoDB` using TLS by using a CDI producer to inject a `MongoDatabase` and MicroProfile Config to make configuring `MongoDB` driver simple.

// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

// =================================================================================================
// Setting up MongoDB
// =================================================================================================

== Setting up MongoDB

Before you begin, you must generate a self-signed certificate, add it to the truststore, install `MongoDB` onto your machine, and setup a new database for the microservice.

=== Generating a self-signed certificate

You will be generating a self-signed certificate `cert.pem` and a private key `private.key`. You will use these files to generate your `mongodb_tls.pem` file which contains both the certificate and private key to start `mongo` using TLS.

Issue the following commands to generate the required files. You will be prompted to enter information pertinent to the certificate. Ensure that you set the Common Name (CN) as `localhost` the prompt appears.

[role='command']
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 365 -keyout assets/security/private.key -out assets/security/cert.pem 
cat assets/security/private.key assets/security/cert.pem > assets/security/mongodb_tls.pem
```

=== Add the certificate to the truststore

Use the Java `keytool` to add the certificate to the truststore. The password for the truststore is `openliberty`.

[role='command']
```
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore assets/security/truststore.p12 -storepass openliberty -storetype PKCS12 -alias mongo -file assets/security/cert.pem
```

Copy the `truststore.p12` file into `start/src/main/liberty/config/resources/security/` and `finish/src/main/liberty/config/resources/security/`. Then, remove it from `assets/security/`.

=== Setting up the MongoDB configuration

mongodb.conf
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::assets/mongodb.conf[]
----

The `mongodb.conf` file specifies the configuration to use when starting a `mongo` instance. A sample configuration file is provided which sets up the [hotspot=storage]`storage` to specify where to store the `mongo` instance's data and [hotspot=net]`net` to setup TLS. Additional configuration options can be found in the official https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/[MongoDB website].

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"] 
---- 
#Update the `mongodb.conf` file.#
`assets/mongodb.conf`
---- 
[role="edit_command_text"]
If you will be using MongoDB on Docker, replace `assets` in `storage.dbPath` and `net.tls.certificateKeyFile` with `/etc/mongodb`. Otherwise, no change is needed.

=== MongoDB installation and setup

If you have Docker, you can execute the following commands to build an image `FROM mongo` and run it in a Docker container using the provided `MongoDB` config (the assets folder will be copied into `/etc/mongodb` in the Docker container):

[role='command']
```
docker build -t mongo-sample .
docker run --name mongo-guide -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 -d mongo-sample --config /etc/mongodb/mongodb.conf
```

If you do not have Docker or want to run `MongoDB` locally, you can install `MongoDB` manually for your operating system from the official https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/[MongoDB website].

After installing `MongoDB` locally, run the following command to start `mongo` using the provided `MongoDB` config:

[role='command']
```
mongod --config assets/mongodb.conf
```

=== Database setup

You will need to create a new database and a user for authentication through the `mongo` Shell. If you are using Docker, you will need to access the container's command line by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
docker exec -it mongo-guide bash
```

Issue the following commands to enter the `mongo` Shell, create a new database, and create a new user for the database (replace `\<<PATH_TO_CERT_FILE>>` with the path to the `cert.pem` file):

[role='command']
```
mongo --tls --tlsCAFile <<PATH_TO_CERT_FILE>>/cert.pem --host localhost
use testdb
db.createUser({user: 'sampleUser', pwd:'openliberty', roles: [{ role: 'readWrite', db:'testdb'}]})
```

See https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/index.html[The mongo Shell] for more information about the using their Shell.

Type `exit` to get out of the `mongo` Shell, and if you are using Docker, type `exit` again to leave the Docker Shell.

// =================================================================================================
// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished microservice. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven 
goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

If you see `The MongoServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The MongoServer server started in 4.300 seconds.` in the console, then it is ready for you check out the microservice through the web interface at the http://localhost:9080/mongo/[^] URL.

After you are done checking out the microservice, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing `CTRL+C`
in the shell session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal 
from the `finish` directory in another shell session:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop
```

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the Open Liberty server in development mode
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the Open Liberty server in development mode

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

Start Open Liberty in development mode, which starts the Open Liberty server and listens 
for file changes:

[role="command"]
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

// =================================================================================================
// Server configuration
// =================================================================================================

== Server configuration

server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The Open Liberty server configuration does the following actions:

. Configures the server to enable JAX-RS. This is specified in the [hotspot=featureManager file=0]`featureManager` element.
. Configures the server to resolve the HTTP port numbers from variables, which are then specified in
the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=defaultHttpsPort file=1]`pom.xml` file. This is specified in the [hotspot=httpEndpoint file=0]`<httpEndpoint/>` element. Variables use the `${variableName}` syntax.
. Configures the server to run the produced microservice on a context root specified in the 
[hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file. This is specified in the [hotspot=webApplication file=0]`<webApplication/>` element.
. Sets up the [hotspot=sslContext file=0]`SSL context` in order to connect to `MongoDB` using TLS.

pom.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

The variables that are being used in the [hotspot=httpEndpoint hotspot=webApplication file=0]`server.xml` file are provided by the properties set in the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=defaultHttpsPort hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file.

=== No need for a MongoDB feature

In the past, using MongoDB required enabling the `mongodb-2.0` feature, which was limited to certain MongoDB 2.X versions. By using a CDI producer, any version of MongoDB can be used, with no need for a specific MongoDB feature. Even if the MongoDB Java Driver API changes, simple updates to your CDI producer will allow it to continue to work. 

The MongoDB driver should be bundled in your microservice. To do this with Maven you can use a dependency:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongo-java-driver</artifactId>
    <version>X.X.X</version>
</dependency>
----

// =================================================================================================
// Creating a CDI Producer for Mongo
// =================================================================================================

== Creating a CDI Producer for Mongo

With a CDI producer, you are no longer restricted to `MongoDB` 2.X versions, and can easily provide a `MongoDatabase` to your microservice. 

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `MongoProducer` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/mongo/MongoProducer.java`
----

MongoProducer.java
[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/mongo/MongoProducer.java[]
----

=== Configuring with MicroProfile Config

Using MicroProfile Config makes configuring the `MongoDB` driver simple.

microprofile-config.properties
[source, properties, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

MongoProducer.java
[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/mongo/MongoProducer.java[]
----

pom.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The values in the [hotspot file=0]`microprofile-config.properties` file are injected into the [hotspot=mongoProducerInjections file=1]`MongoProducer` class.

=== Using an encoded password with passwordUtilities-1.0

One of the advantages of using a CDI producer is that it can be tailored to your needs. For improved security, the [hotspot=createMongo file=1]`createMongo` method includes authentication with a [hotspot=username file=1]`user name` and an [hotspot=encodedPassword file=1]`encoded password` which is decoded using [hotspot=passwordUtil file=1]`passwordUtilities-1.0`. 

This tool is included in `pom.xml` as a [hotspot=passwordUtilDependency file=2]`dependency` and added to `server.xml` as a [hotspot=passwordUtilFeature file=3]`feature`.

=== Using TLS

Since you started your `MongoDB` server using the TLS, you must setup the SSL context in your Open Liberty server accordingly. The `ssl` dependency is imported in the [hotspot=sslDependency file=2]`pom.xml` and enabled in the [hotspot=sslFeature file=3]`server.xml`. Additionally, the SSL context is setup in the [hotspot=sslContext file=3]`server.xml` to use the `TLS` protocol, the default keystore and your truststore which contains the public key. In your [hotspot file=1]`MongoProducer`, the [hotspot=sslContext file=1]`SSL context` is retrieved using the `JSSEHelper` and it is included in the [hotspot=sslEnable file=1]`MongoClientOptions`.

// =================================================================================================
// Basic CRUD operations
// =================================================================================================

== Basic CRUD operations

You will be implementing the basic `CRUD` operations which are `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. The http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/package-summary.html[com.mongodb.client] package is used to help implement these `CRUD` operations for the microservice. The http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoDatabase.html#getCollection(java.lang.String)[MongoDatabase.getCollection()] method will be used to return http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html[MongoCollection<TDocument>], a generic with a `TDocument` type parameter. For this guide, you will be using http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/?org/bson/BsonDocument.html[Document] as the type. Furthermore, several methods from http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html[MongoCollection] will be used to interact with the collection to implement the `CRUD` operations.

See https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web serivce] for more information about creating a REST service with JAX-RS, JSON-B, and Open Liberty.

----

A [hotspot=beanValidator]`Validator` is used to validate the [hotspot=crewMember file=1]`CrewMember` before inserting or updating the database.

=== Injecting the database

The CDI producer is used to inject a [hotspot=dbInjection]`MongoDatabase` into the [hotspot file=0]`CrewService` class.

Visit http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui/[^] to test and see the API documentation for the next sections.

=== Create
The http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#insertOne-TDocument-[MongoCollection.insertOne()] method is used to insert a new document into the collection. This method takes in a `TDocument` which contains the configuration of the new crew member to be inserted into the collection and does not return anything. The [hotspot=create]`add()` method handles the implementation of `CREATE`.

Test the `CREATE` endpoint through the OpenAPI UI with the following as the request body:
```
{
  "name": "Member1",
  "rank": "Officer",
  "crewID": "000001"
}
```

You will receive a response containing the JSON object of the new member.

```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  },
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Officer",
  "CrewID": "000001"
}
```

The `\<<ID>>` is a unique identifier in the database. Save this value for future commands.

=== Read
The http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#find--[MongoCollection.find()] method is used to retrieve an iterable of all the crew member documents in the collection. This method does not take in any arguments and returns a http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html[FindIterable] object. The [hotspot=read]`retrieve()` method handles the implementation of `READ`.

Test the `READ` endpoint from the OpenAPI UI.

You will receive a response containing an array of all the members currently in your crew.

```
[
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "<<ID>>"
    },
    "Name": "Member1",
    "Rank": "Officer",
    "CrewID": "000001"
  }
]
```

=== Update
The http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#replaceOne-org.bson.conversions.Bson-TDocument-[MongoCollection.replaceOne()] method is used update a specified document. This method takes in a http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html[Bson] which contains the object id of the document to be replaced and another `TDocument` which contains the new configuration of the crew member. The method returns an http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/result/UpdateResult.html[UpdateResult] object with a method called `getMatchedCount()` which indicates the number of matches to the query. The [hotspot=update]`update()` method handles the implementation of `UPDATE`.

Test the `UPDATE` endpoint from the OpenAPI UI by specifying the `\<<ID>>` you saved from the `CREATE` section in the id parameter and setting the request body as:
```
{
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Captain",
  "CrewID": "000001"
}
```

You will receive a reponse containing the JSON object of the updated member.

```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  },
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Captain",
  "CrewID": "000001"
}
```

=== Delete
The http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#deleteOne-org.bson.conversions.Bson-[MongoCollection.deleteOne()] method is used to remove a document from the collection. This method takes in a http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html[Bson] which contains the object id of the document to be deleted and returns a http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.8/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/result/DeleteResult.html[DeleteResult] object with a method called `getDeletedCount()` to indicate the number of documents deleted from the collection. The [hotspot=delete]`remove()` method handles the implementation of `DELETE`.

Test the `DELETE` endpoint from the OpenAPI UI by specifying the `\<<ID>>` you saved from `CREATE` section in the id parameter.

You will receive a response containing the object id of the deleted crew member.

```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```

// =================================================================================================
// Running the microservice
// =================================================================================================

== Running the microservice

The Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide and all the 
changes were automatically picked up.

If you see `The MongoServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The MongoServer server started in 4.300 seconds.` in the console, then it is ready for you to check out the microservice that you created at the http://localhost:9080/mongo/[^] URL. 

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the service
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the service

You can test this microservice manually by starting a server and sending HTTP requests to http://localhost:9080/mongo/crew/[^] or by using the web interface at the http://localhost:9080/mongo/[^] URL. Automated tests are a much better
approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. The JUnit and the JAX-RS Client
API provide a simple environment to test the microservice.

You can write tests to call the microservice server directly.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `CrewApplicationEndpointIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/application/CrewApplicationEndpointIT.java`
----

CrewApplicationEndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/application/CrewApplicationEndpointIT.java[]
----

The test method is annotated with the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` annotation.

pom.xml
[source , xml, linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

The test code needs to know some information about the microservice to make requests. The server port and the microservice context root are key, and are dictated by the server configuration. While this information can be hardcoded, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file. Refer to the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` file to see how the microservice information such as the [hotspot=defaultHttpPort file=1]`http.port` and [hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`default.app.context.root` elements are provided in the file.


These Maven properties are then passed to the Java test program as the [hotspot=testsysprops file=1]`<systemPropertyVariables/>` element in the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` file.

The [hotspot=Before file=0]`@BeforeAll` annotation is placed on a method that runs before any of the test cases. In this case, the method creates a JAX-RS client, which makes HTTP requests to the crew service, it also retrieves the port number and microservice context for the Open Liberty server, creates testing crew member data and builds a base URL string that is used throughout the tests.

The [hotspot=After file=0]`@AfterAll` with [hotspot=teardown file=0]`teardown()` method simply destroys the client instance.

See the following descriptions of the test cases:

* [hotspot=testAddCrewMember file=0]`testAddCrewMember()` verifies that new members are correctly added to the database.

* [hotspot=testUpdateCrewMember file=0]`testUpdateCrewMember()` verifies that a crew member information is correctly updated.

* [hotspot=testGetCrewMembers file=0]`testGetCrewMembers()` verifies that a list of crew members returned by the microservice API.

* [hotspot=testDeleteCrewMember file=0]`testDeleteCrewMember()` verifies that the crew members are correctly removed from the database.

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in development mode at the start of the guide, press
`enter/return` key to run the tests. You will see the following output:

To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing
assertion to an unexpected constant value.

When you are done checking out the application, exit development mode by typing `q` in the shell session where
you ran the server and then pressing the `enter/return` key.
