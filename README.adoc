Learn how to persist data to a document-oriented MongoDB database for your microservices.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple microservice which manages the members of a crew using `MongoDB`. The microservice will respond to `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests made to the service to manipulate the database.

The crew members will be stored in `MongoDB` as documents in the following JSON-like format:

[source,json,role="no_copy"]
----
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "5dee6b079503234323db2ebc"
  },
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Captain",
  "CrewID": "000001"
}
----

This microservice connects to `MongoDB` using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and injects a `MongoDatabase` instance into the service through a CDI producer.  Additionally, MicroProfile Config is used to easily configure the `MongoDB` driver.

For more information about CDI and MicroProfile Config, see https://openliberty.io/guides/cdi-intro.html[Injecting dependencies into microservices^] and https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[Separating configuration from code in microservices^].

// =================================================================================================
// Additional Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Additional Prerequisites

You will be using Docker to run an instance of `MongoDB` for a fast installation and setup. Install Docker by following the instructions on the official https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation[Docker documentation^] and start your Docker environment.

// =================================================================================================
// Setting up MongoDB
// =================================================================================================

== Setting up MongoDB

This guide uses Docker to run an instance of `MongoDB`. A multi-stage Dockerfile is provided which uses the `mongo` image as the final stage's base image and will gather the required configuration files. Then, the resulting `mongo` image will run in a Docker container and you will need to setup a new database for the microservice. Lastly, the truststore generated in the Docker image will be copied from the container and placed into the Open Liberty server.

Additional details and configuration options can be found in the official https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/[MongoDB website^]. For more information about the mongo docker image, see https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo[mongo^] in Docker Hub.

**Running MongoDB in a Docker container**

Execute the following commands to build the image using the Dockerfile, run it in a Docker container, and map port `27017` from the container to your host machine:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t mongo-sample -f assets/Dockerfile .
docker run --name mongo-guide -p 27017:27017 -d mongo-sample
```

**Adding the truststore to the Open Liberty server**

The truststore created in the container needs to be added to the Open Liberty server, so the server can trust the certificate `MongoDB` presents when they are connecting. Execute the following command to copy the `truststore.p12` file from the container to the correct folder in the start and finish directories on your host machine:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following
Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

After you see the following message, your application server is ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Check out the service at the
http://localhost:9080/mongo/[^] URL.

// =================================================================================================

== Configuring the server

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

To create a CDI producer for `MongoDB` and connect over TLS, the Open Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

pom.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

After you replace the `server.xml` file, Open Liberty automatically reloads its configuration. 

The features required to create the CDI producer for `MongoDB` are [hotspot=cdiFeature file=0]`cdi-2.0`, [hotspot=sslFeature file=0]`ssl-1.0`, [hotspot=mpConfigFeature file=0]`mpConfig-1.4`, and [hotspot=passwordUtilFeature file=0]`passwordUtilities-1.0` which are specified in the [hotspot=featureManager file=0]`featureManager` element. In the past, using `MongoDB` required enabling the `mongodb-2.0` feature, which was limited to certain `MongoDB` 2.x versions. By using a CDI producer, any version of MongoDB can be used, with no need for a specific `MongoDB` feature. Even if the `MongoDB` Java Driver API changes, simple updates to your CDI producer will allow it to continue to work. The `MongoDB` driver is bundled in your microservice in your [hotspot=mongoDriver file=1]`pom.xml`.

Additionally, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) context is configured in the [hotspot file=0]`server.xml` so the application can connect to `MongoDB` using TLS. The [hotspot=keyStore file=0]`keyStore` element is configured with an `id` of `outboundTrustStore` to point to the `truststore.p12` keystore file created in one of the earlier sections with the password of `mongodb` and type of `PKCS12`. The [hotspot=ssl file=0]`ssl` element is configured with an id of `outboundSSLContext` to use the `defaultKeyStore` as the keystore, `outboundTrustStore` as the truststore, and `TLS` as the SSL protocol.

Using MicroProfile Config makes configuring the `MongoDB` driver simple since all the configuration can be set in one place and injected into the CDI producer.

Properties such as the [hotspot=hostname file=2]`hostname`, [hotspot=port file=2]`port`, and [hotspot=dbname file=2]`database name` for the running `MongoDB` instance are set. Additionally, the user's [hotspot=mongoUser file=2]`username` and [hotspot=passEncoded file=2]`password` are set here. For added security, the password was encoded using `securityUtility`.

For reference on how the encoded password was generated, navigate to the `target/liberty/wlp/bin/` directory in a separate command-line session and run the following command:

--
[role='command']
```
./securityUtility encode openliberty --encoding=aes
```
--

This generates an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encoding of the password `openliberty`.

== Using a CDI producer for MongoDB

With a CDI producer, you are no longer restricted to `MongoDB` 2.x versions, and can easily provide a `MongoDatabase` to your microservice.

This class contains a producer method for the `MongoClient`, a producer method for the `MongoDatabase` which uses the `MongoClient` producer method, and a dispose method for the `MongoClient`.

Before creating the methods, the values in the [hotspot file=1]`microprofile-config.properties` file are injected into the [hotspot=mongoProducerInjections file=0]`MongoProducer` class. 

The [hotspot=createMongo file=0]`createMongo()` method is annotated with [hotspot=produces1 file=0]`@Produces` and returns an instance of `MongoClient`. Firstly, the function decodes the encoded password using the [hotspot=decode file=0]`PasswordUtil.passwordDecode()` method from the [hotspot=passwordUtilFeature file=3]`passwordUtilities-1.0` feature. Then, the `username`, `database name`, and `decoded password` are passed into the [hotspot=createCredential file=0]`MongoCredential.createCredential()` method to get an instance of `MongoCredential`. The [hotspot=sslContext file=0]`JSSEHelper` is used to get the `SSLContext` from the [hotspot=outboundSSLContext file=0]`outboundSSLContext` created in the [hotspot=ssl file=3]`server.xml`. Lastly, a [hotspot=mongoClient file=0]`MongoClient` instance is created and returned. The [hotspot=mongoClient file=0]`MongoClient` instance was created using an instance of [hotspot=serverAddress file=0]`ServerAddress` which contains the hostname and port, the [hotspot=creds file=0]`MongoCredential` instance, and an instance of [hotspot=optionsBuilder file=0]`MongoClientOptions` which enables SSL and specifies the SSL context.

The [hotspot=createDB file=0]`createDB()` method is annotated with [hotspot=produces2 file=0]`@Produces` and returns an instance of `MongoDatabase`. The method injects the [hotspot=injectMongoClient file=0]`MongoClient` in its parameters and invokes the [hotspot=getDatabase file=0]`MongoClient.getDatabase()` method, passing in the database name to get the `MongoDatabase` instance. The [hotspot=getDatabase file=0]`MongoDatabase` instance is returned.

The [hotspot=close file=0]`close()` method is a cleanup function for the `MongoClient`. The method injects the `MongoClient` in its parameters, annotated with [hotspot=disposes file=0]`@Disposes`. The [hotspot=toClose file=0]`MongoClient.close()` method is invoked to close the connection to the `MongoDB` instance.

// =================================================================================================
// Implementing CRUD operations
// =================================================================================================

== Performing CRUD operations

You will be implementing the basic `CRUD` operations which are `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. The [hotspot=mongoImports1]`com.mongodb.client` and [hotspot=mongoImports2]`com.mongodb.client.result` packages are used to help implement these `CRUD` operations for the microservice. For more information about these packages, see the https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.12/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/package-summary.html[com.mongodb.client^] and https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.12/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/result/package-summary.html[com.mongodb.client.result^] Javadocs.

See https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web serivce^] for more information about creating a REST service with JAX-RS, JSON-B, and Open Liberty.

A [hotspot=beanValidator]`Validator` is used to validate the [hotspot=crewMember file=1]`CrewMember` using the [hotspot=getViolations]`getViolations()` method before inserting or updating the database by using the [hotspot=add]`add()` or [hotspot=update]`update()` method respectively.

The CDI producer is used to inject a [hotspot=dbInjection]`MongoDatabase` into the [hotspot file=0]`CrewService` class.

Visit the http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui/[^] URL to view the OpenAPI UI which provides API documentation and a client to test the API endpoints you will create.

=== Implementing Create operation

The [hotspot=add]`add()` method handles the implementation of `CREATE`. An instance of `MongoCollection` is retrieved by invoking [hotspot=getCollection]`MongoDatabase.getCollection()` method and specifying the `Crew` collection. The `MongoCollection<TDocument>` is a generic with a `TDocument` type parameter. The `TDocument` type parameter specifies the document type used to store data in the `MongoCollection`. The [hotspot=bsonDocument]`Document` class will be used as the `TDocument` type for this guide. The crew member is converted to a [hotspot=crewMemberCreation]`Document` and the [hotspot=insertOne]`MongoCollection.insertOne()` method is called to insert the new crew member `Document`.

Test the `CREATE` operation through the OpenAPI UI at the `POST /api/crew` endpoint with the following as the request body:

[role='command']
```
{
  "name": "Member1",
  "rank": "Officer",
  "crewID": "000001"
}
```

This will create a new document in the `Crew` collection with a Name of `Member1`, Rank of `Officer`, and CrewID of `000001`.

You will receive a response containing the JSON object of the new member.

[role="no_copy"]
```
{
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Officer",
  "CrewID": "000001",
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```

The `\<<ID>>` is a unique identifier in the collection. Save this value for future commands.

=== Implementing Read operation

The [hotspot=retrieve]`retrieve()` method handles the implementation of `READ`. Firstly the `Crew` collection is retrieved using [hotspot=getCollectionRead]`MongoDatabase.getCollection()`. The [hotspot=find]`MongoCollection.find()` method is invoked to retrieve a `FindIterable<TDocument>` generic using the `Document` type, which is iterable for all the crew members documents in the collection. Each document is concatenated into a String array to be returned.

Test the `READ` operation from the OpenAPI UI at the `GET /api/crew` endpoint.

This will retrieve all crew member documents from the collection.

You will receive a response containing an array of all the members currently in your crew. The response may include crew members created in the **Try what you'll build** section.

[role="no_copy"]
```
[
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "<<ID>>"
    },
    "Name": "Member1",
    "Rank": "Officer",
    "CrewID": "000001"
  }
]
```

=== Implementing Update operation

The [hotspot=update]`update()` method handles the implementation of `UPDATE`. Firstly, the `Crew` collection is retrieved using [hotspot=getCollectionUpdate]`MongoDatabase.getCollection()`. Then, a [hotspot=queryUpdate]`Document` is created with the specified object id to query the collection. Next, a new crew member [hotspot=crewMemberUpdate]`Document` is created using the updated configuration. The [hotspot=replaceOne]`MongoCollection.replaceOne()` method is called with the query and new crew member document which will update all matching queries with the supplied document. Since the object id is unique in the collection, only one document will be updated. The [hotspot=replaceOne]`MongoCollection.replaceOne()` method will return an `UpdateResult`. The [hotspot=getMatchedCount]`UpdateResult.getMatchedCount()` method is invoked to determine the number of documents that matched the query. If the match count is 0, then the object id does not exist.

Test the `UPDATE` operation from the OpenAPI UI at the `PUT /api/crew/\{id\}` endpoint by specifying the `\<<ID>>` you saved from the `CREATE` section in the id parameter and setting the request body as:

[role='command']
```
{
  "name": "Member1",
  "rank": "Captain",
  "crewID": "000001"
}
```

This will update the rank of the crew member you created in the `CREATE` step from Officer to Captain.

You will receive a reponse containing the JSON object of the updated member.

[role="no_copy"]
```
{
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Captain",
  "CrewID": "000001",
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```

=== Implementing Delete operation

The [hotspot=remove]`remove()` method handles the implementation of `DELETE`. Firstly, the `Crew` collection is retrieved using [hotspot=getCollectionDelete]`MongoDatabase.getCollection()`. Then, a [hotspot=queryDelete]`Document` is created with the specified object id to query the collection. The [hotspot=deleteOne]`MongoCollection.deleteOne()` method is called with the query. Since the object id is unique in the collection, only one document will be deleted. The [hotspot=deleteOne]`MongoCollection.deleteOne()` will return a `DeleteResult`. The [hotspot=getDeletedCount]`DeleteResult.getDeletedCount()` method is invoked to determine the number of documents that were deleted. If the deleted count is 0, then the object id does not exist.

Test the `DELETE` operation from the OpenAPI UI at the `DELETE /api/crew/\{id\}` endpoint by specifying the `\<<ID>>` you saved from `CREATE` section in the id parameter.

This will remove the document containing the specified crew member object id from the collection.

You will receive a response containing the object id of the deleted crew member.

[role="no_copy"]
```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```
